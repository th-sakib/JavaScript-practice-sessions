# Tasks

Please complete the following tasks and post them on the tapaScript Discord under "40 Days of JavaScript".

> **DO NOT USE AI to FIND ANSWERS**. If you are stuck, let's discuss it on DISCORD and learn. Also, please note that none of the answers need you to create any UI. Just focus on the logic building and print the output on the browser console.

## 1. What will be the output of the following code and why?

```js
let user = "Alice";

function outer() {
  function inner() {
    console.log(user);
  }
  let user = "Bob";
  inner();
}

outer();
```

## 2. What is the mistake in the code below?

```js
let total = 0; // Global, bad practice

function add(num) {
  total += num;
}

add(5);
add(10);
console.log(total);
```

## 3. Create a function with a nested function and log a variable from the parent function.

## 4. Use a loop inside a function and declare a variable inside the loop. Can you access it outside?

## 5. Write a function that tries to access a variable declared inside another function.

## 6. What will be the output and why?

```js
console.log(a);
let a = 10;
```

## 7. Where is the `age` variable accessible?

```js
function showAge() {
  let age = 25;
  console.log(age);
}

console.log(age);
```

Options:

- A: In Global
- B: Only inside showAge
- C: It will cause an error
- D: None of the above

## 8. What will be the output and explain the output?

```js
let message = "Hello";

function outer() {
  let message = "Hi";

  function inner() {
    console.log(message);
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

## 9. What will be the output and why?

```js
let x = "Global";

function outer() {
  let x = "Outer";

  function inner() {
    let x = "Inner";
    console.log(x);
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

JavaScript functions can access variables from their own scope and from enclosing scopes (lexical scoping). In this case, the inner() function looks in its own scope first, then in the outer() function scope, and finally in the global scope if necessary.

## 10. What will be the output and why?

```js
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count--;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const reduce = counter();
reduce();
reduce();
```

the value of count will be memoized and thats why it will be -2
