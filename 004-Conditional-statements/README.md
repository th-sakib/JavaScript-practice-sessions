# Conditional Statements

### 1. JS code runs synchronously and line by line.

### 2. But using if-else, switch and so on we can skip some part of our code if we want.

## if-else if - else :

### 1. helps us to conditionally run a chunk of code.

## switch case:

### 1. when we need to check deferent scenarios based on one condition than use switch statement. (we can consider it, alternative of if else )

### 2. it is more performant than if else.

### 3. but for complex conditions its better to use if-else.
