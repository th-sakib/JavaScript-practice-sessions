# Types of Streams in Node.js

- Node.js streams allow you to work with data efficiently by processing it incrementally, without loading the entire data into memory. 
- Streams are particularly useful for handling large datasets or continuous data flows. 

**There are four types of streams in Node.js:**
## 1. Readable Streams
Readable streams are used to **read data** from a source, such as reading files or receiving HTTP requests.

## 2. Writable Streams
Writable streams are used to **write data** to a destination, such as writing to a file or sending HTTP responses.

## 3. Duplex Streams
Duplex streams are streams that can **both read and write data**. These are useful for situations like network communication, where you both send and receive data.

## 4. Transform Streams
Transform streams are a special type of duplex stream where the **output is a transformation of the input**. They modify or process the data as it passes through the stream, such as compressing or encrypting data.
