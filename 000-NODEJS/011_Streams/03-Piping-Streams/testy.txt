# pipeline

In Node.js, pipeline() is the recommended way to pipe streams together. It not only connects streams but also automatically handles errors and cleans up resources. ✅

## 🔧 How to Use

```js
import { pipeline } from "stream";

pipeline(readStream, writeStream, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("❌ Pipeline failed:", err);
  } else {
    console.log("✅ Pipeline finished successfully!");
  }
});
```
